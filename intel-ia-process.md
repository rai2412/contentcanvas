# Information Architecture Redesign Process
## Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library

This document outlines the comprehensive content strategy and information architecture redesign process I employed for the Intel oneAPI oneDNN documentation.

## Step 1: Persona Analysis

My first step was to understand the audience I'm writing for. I interviewed product and engineering teams at Intel to get an insight into the persona, understand their typical workflow to onboard and get started with the library.

**Key Activities:**
- Conducted stakeholder interviews with product managers and engineers
- Identified primary user personas (ML researchers, AI framework engineers, performance optimization specialists)
- Mapped typical user workflows and onboarding journeys
- Documented pain points and information needs for each persona

**Outcome:** Clear understanding of target audience needs and expectations

---

## Step 2: Content Audit

I completed a comprehensive audit of existing documentation pages, identifying gaps, redundancies, outdated content, and areas with poor readability scores that caused friction during developer onboarding.

**Key Activities:**
- Reviewed all existing documentation pages
- Identified content gaps and redundancies
- Analyzed readability scores and technical accuracy
- Documented user feedback and pain points
- Assessed navigation and findability issues

**Outcome:** Comprehensive inventory of content issues and improvement opportunities

---

## Step 3: Journey Mapping

I created detailed developer journey maps for the key persona and mapped pain points and opportunities at each stage.

**Key Activities:**
- Mapped the complete developer journey from discovery to advanced usage
- Identified critical touchpoints and decision points
- Documented pain points at each stage
- Highlighted opportunities for content improvement
- Created user story maps for different use cases

**Outcome:** Visual representation of user experience with clear improvement areas

---

## Step 4: Competitive Analysis

I analyzed competitor documentation to identify best practices and opportunities for differentiation.

**Key Activities:**
- Reviewed documentation from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and other ML libraries
- Analyzed information architecture approaches
- Identified successful navigation patterns
- Documented best practices in developer onboarding
- Noted opportunities to differentiate oneDNN documentation

**Outcome:** Industry benchmark and best practice reference

## Step 5: Information Architecture Design and Building a Learning Path

Designed new documentation structure using card sorting and tree testing with actual users. Organized content around user tasks rather than technical components.

**Key Activities:**
- Conducted card sorting exercises with developers
- Performed tree testing to validate navigation structure
- Reorganized content by user tasks and goals (not technical components)
- Created clear learning paths for different personas
- Designed progressive disclosure of technical complexity
- Developed quick-start guides and tutorials

**Outcome:** User-centered information architecture aligned with developer workflows

---

## Step 6: Implementation and Iteration

**Key Activities:**
- Restructured Getting Started section with step-by-step instructions
- Created task-based navigation aligned with developer workflows
- Wrote clear code examples for common use cases
- Added troubleshooting guides based on user feedback
- Implemented progressive disclosure of complex topics

---

## Step 7: Measurement & Optimization

I tracked key metrics (user satisfaction, page views, bounce rates) and continued optimizing content based on data insights.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- User satisfaction scores (30% improvement)
- Page readability scores (20% improvement)
- Adoption rate (10% improvement)
- Time to first success
- Page views and bounce rates
- Search effectiveness

**Outcome:** Data-driven continuous improvement cycle
