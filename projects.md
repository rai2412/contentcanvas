## Intel oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library Documentation

## Description

Led content redesign project for Intel's Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN), implementing new information architecture based on user research, customer journey analytics, and competitive analysis. 

Working with engineers, product managers, UX researchers, I overhauled the oneDNN documentation structure, conducted comprehensive content audits, created detailed developer journey maps, and implemented a new information architecture organized around user tasks rather than technical components.

**Key Results:**
- Improved user satisfaction score by 30%
- Increased readability score by 20%
- Improved adoption rate by 10%

## Tech Stack

**Documentation Tools:** Sphinx, RestructuredText, VSCode, Git/GitHub, CMake, Linux

**Methodologies:** Content strategy, UX research, journey mapping, competitive analysis, analytics-driven decision making

## NetApp BlueXP REST API Documentation

## Description

Designed and implemented structural framework for documenting cloud REST API workflows for NetApp BlueXP, a platform that enables management of hybrid multicloud architecture for enterprise developers.

User feedback indicated that comprehensive API documentation was necessary. There was inconsistency across product in terms of voice, tone, and style. The existing legacy structure made it difficult for developers to find information quickly.

Created comprehensive API documentation including endpoints, request/response examples, authentication flows, and conceptual content. Developed 40+ REST API workflows for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud that align closely with developer workflows. Created internal templates to standardize documentation across APIs, improving team efficiency and reducing editing errors by 10%.

**Key Results:**
- Increased developer satisfaction by 20%
- Reduced editing errors by 10%
- Documented 40+ API workflows

## Tech Stack

**Documentation Tools:** AsciiDoc, JSON, Jekyll, VSCode, Git/GitHub

**API Tools:** OpenAPI specification, Swagger, Postman

**Methodologies:** API documentation principles, workflow documentation, content strategy

**Collaboration:** Engineering, product, and QA teams
