## Project Overview

Improve the onboarding experience of open-source users for an AI performance library and ensure adoption and retention of users. The goal was to make the links navigable and the content accessible so that the end users can quickly find what they need to get started. Attended meetings with engineering stakeholders, product managers, UX teams to align on the business goals and the content strategy. 
 
The key deliverable was to devise an improved onboarding flow with recommendations for copy and design changes.

## My role

Being the content strategy lead of the project, I developed a content strategy framework to align content with the user flow. Collboaretd with the XX researchers, to identify the friction points and usability issues. Participated in usability studies to assess pain points of the AI framework developers and map the areas of improvements on a developer journey map.

## The research

In order to create an experience that will resonate with the target audience, me along with the other stakeholders created the following.

### Research priorities

-	Identify the prominent persona who interacts with the library
-	Identify the key competitors in the marketplace and learn their documentation approach to support the onboarding experience

### Research methods used

#### Stakeholder interviews  
Engage with internal stakeholders (engineering team and product manager) to 
#### Conversation mining 
Analyzing real conversations across platforms (Slack, GitHub, Discord, forums, Twitter, support tickets, etc.) to extract insights about developer behavior, needs, and feedback.
#### Content audit 
List all content items across platforms (website, blog, YouTube, GitHub, Docs,) using Screaming Frog and evaluate whether the content aligns with current messaging or product features.

#### Competitor analysis 
Understand the key competitors in the market and asses the areas of improvement for the product documentation; analysis criteria included readability, clarity and completeness, visibility, and relevance.

####	Developer journey map 

Visualize the end-to-end experience of an AI developer interacting with the library from exploration to adoption and contribution phase. The journey mapping helped to unravel the following:
o	-- Identify friction points in onboarding or usage
o	-- Understand developer motivations and blockers
o	-- Improve documentation, tooling, support, and community experience
o	-- Align product and engineering around real developer experience

#### Usability study
Participated in evaluation of how AI developers interact with the AI library. It uncovered pain points, confusion, or inefficiencies in the user experience, things you won’t catch just by reading feedback or analytics.
The usability studies help you:
•	Identify friction in onboarding or docs
•	Improve the developer experience (DX)
•	Validate assumptions with real users
•	Reduce support burden by catching confusing flows early
•	Increase adoption and engagement

## Improved documentation structure

•	UX and analytics-led informational structure
•	Aligning the documentation with the developer journey
