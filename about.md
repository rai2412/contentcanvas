# About Me

I began my professional career as a software developer. What motivated me to transition into technical writing was my deep interest in language and linguistics and the passion to create documentation that developers will actually care about. As a software developer, I have faced the challenge in real-time navigating  through poorly written documentation. It doesn't need to be a struggle when it comes to understanding technology. 

I find immense satisfaction in simplifying complex technology and presenting it in a way that is understandable on the first read. 

# Recent Work

Most recently, I was a Software Technical Writer at Intel Corporation. Working with engineers, product managers, UX researchers, I overhauled the oneDNN documentation, implemented new information architecture, and contributed to improving user satisfaction by 30%. I also helped transform the documentation into a faster, more discoverable resource for developers. The result was a major boost in usability and reach—higher search rankings, stronger engagement, and a smoother overall experience for users. 

It was deeply satisfying to align the cross-functional teams such the AI engineering team, prouduct team, and UX research team into one vision as a content startegist. There were many hurdles along the way however, efficient communication skills, passion for simplifying the critical developer workflows made the job even more exciting. Challenges like these motivate me to mosey along the path of technical writing savouring each minute.

It takes a lot of curiosity, tenacity, and diligence to learn the required information and distill it into valuable user documentation.
